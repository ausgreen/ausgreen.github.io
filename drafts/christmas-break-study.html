    <p>One of the benefits of curiosity is that almost anything can seem interesting.
The downside is that this curiosity can lead to wasting time on unimportant things.</p>
<p>For my Christmas break I didn't want to waste my time.  I decided to make something
useful during all this excess free time.</p>
<h6>What Topic Should I Research?</h6>
<p>I want to apply what I learned during my first semester in the MS Analytics
program at GaTech.  I believe it is important to contribute to your community
so I believe I can add some value by analyzing birmingham alabama.
<em>(awk)</em></p>
<p>I posed a poll to my facebook friends with the question:
Which Research topic is more interesting?
(image of research topic in output/images)</p>
<p>These topics were kept broad on purpose.  Both are interesting
topics and certainly have value.  However the uncertainty of what information
is available kept the topics from becoming focused.  Since this is a
free time project with a brief deadline, the data collection process
has to be brief.</p>
<h6>What types of information is available in prepared datasets/databases?</h6>
